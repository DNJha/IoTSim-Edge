# IoTSIM

To reduce the complexity of the code, we used lombok in the pom.xml which provides getter and setter for different variables automatically. Based on the version of the Eclipse, lombok version need to updated. If this does not work, please download the jar file from  https://projectlombok.org/downloads/lombok.jar and install using command line > java -jar lombok.jar. Finally restart the Eclipse to make the change effective.

The IoTSim-Edge codebase is dependent on CloudSim which is provided as external jar file located in EdgeIoTSim\lib folder. One has to change the location of CloudSim jar file to compile succesfully.

## Architecture

IoTSim-Edge is composed of the following components:

- Edge devices: These devices perform computation and storage at the edge of the network. Examples include smart cameras, smart locks, and sensors.
- Gateway: This edge device acts as a bridge between the edge devices and the cloud.
- Broker: This message broker facilitates communication between the edge devices.
- Cloud: This is the central cloud infrastructure that processes the data generated by the edge devices.

## Configuration

IoTSim-Edge can be configured using a YAML configuration file. The configuration file specifies the simulation parameters, including the edge devices, communication protocols, and simulation duration.

## Usage

To use IoTSim-Edge, follow these steps:

1. Define the edge devices: Create a YAML file that defines the edge devices, including their properties and communication protocols.

2. Define the simulation parameters: Create a YAML file that specifies the simulation parameters, including the simulation duration, the communication protocols, and the data generated by the edge devices.

3. Run the simulation: Use the `main.py` script to run the simulation.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use IoTSim-Edge:

- `example1.py`: Simulate a simple edge computing system with two sensors and a gateway.
- `example2.py`: Simulate a more complex edge
